# React / NextJS user authentication.

A client-side web app with sign up and log in.

## Please note

This client is intended to be used with [prisma-graphql-auth](https://github.com/rsbear/prisma-graphql-auth), a GraphQL server I built to manage Authentication.

## Getting started

Please make sure you have a server running, whether it be mine or one of your own.  
Change your endpoint to wherever your server is running  
`lib/initApollo.js`
and change `configApi` to your uri

Install dependencies  
`yarn install`  
Start the app  
`yarn start`
